# Sugar-Bunnies-p5
A simply drawing of the Sugar Bunnies characters from Sanrio! Done using the p5JS library. I really enjoyed doing this drawing as Sanrio characters are a big interest of mine! I love how their designs are able to portray a level of cuteness that captures the hearts of so many people, including me. Please enjoy my drawing ૮꒰ ˶• ༝ •˶꒱ა ♡
